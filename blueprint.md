# Web Browser

## Overview

This is a simple web browser application that allows users to navigate to and view websites.

## Features

*   An address bar to enter a URL.
*   A "Go" button to navigate to the entered URL.
*   An `<iframe>` to display the content of the requested website.

## Current Plan

*   **index.html**: Create the main structure with an address bar, a navigation button, and an iframe to display web pages.
*   **main.js**: Implement the logic to take the URL from the input and load it into the iframe.
*   **style.css**: Style the browser components for a clean and user-friendly interface.
